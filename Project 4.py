##  Problem: File Transposition
##  
##  Algorithm:
##  Ask the user whether they want to 1. encipher a file, 2. decipher a file, or Q.  quit
##  Error handling if the enter a response other than 1,2, or Q
##  Ask the user which file they wish to encipher or decipher
##  Error handling for if the user enters a file that doesnâ€™t exist
##  Ask the user which file they wish to write to
##  For encipher:
##  	Take each individual character of the string.
##      If the index of that character divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 (example: 4/2=2.0 5/2=2.5)
##      then the character in question is added to a new string called first.
##      If the index divided by 2 has any remainder, then the character is added to a new string called second.
##      Once the original string has been fully examined, the transposed new string is equal to first + second.
##  This process is repeated for each line of the file. Once the entirety of the file has been dealt with, the file will close
##  For decipher:
##  	Split the string in half. The first character of the first half and the first character of the second half are added to make a new string.
##      And so on and so on until both the first half and second half are used up and the new string is complete.
##      Write the new string into a new file. Continue onto the next line until there is no more lines to read. Close file(s)
##  This process is repeated for each line of the file. Once the entirety of the file has been dealt with, the file will close
##  For Quit:
##  	Exit the program
##  Repeat the first step once the new file is written.
##  
##
##  Error handling:
##      If the user submits a response other than 1, 2, or Q
##      if the user submits a file that doesn't exist
